If the CSV file, oil_companies.csv, does not exist, the IPython notebook, oil_energy_sector.ipynb, generates it by sorting through the entire Yahoo Finance database: this process usually takes one hour.  For future runs, this IPython notebook instead reads the oil_companies.csv file, a process that usually takes 1.5 minutes.
